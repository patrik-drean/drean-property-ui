# Cursor ignore file
# This file tells Cursor what to ignore, overriding .gitignore for AI context

# Allow Cursor to access .env files for better context
# (These are still ignored by git via .gitignore)

# You can add other patterns here that you want Cursor to ignore
# but keep in git, or vice versa

# Example: If you want Cursor to ignore certain large files:
# *.log
# node_modules/
# bin/
# obj/
